1. What happened when you inserted another row with the same primary key as an existing row?

    The existing row got overwritten.

2. What happened when you query a keyspace with replication factor 1 and one node down? How did it behave with 
replication factor 2 and a node down?

    Running a query with factor 1 sometimes worked, but some times raised the below error:
        NoHostAvailable: ('Unable to complete the operation against any hosts', {<Host: 10.17.203.211:9042 datacenter1>:
        Unavailable('Error from server: code=1000 [Unavailable exception] message="Cannot achieve consistency level ONE"
        info={\'consistency\': \'ONE\', \'required_replicas\': 1, \'alive_replicas\': 0}')})

    Factor 2 seemed to work fine all of the time.

3. How did the consistency level affect the results with the node up/down?

    Consistency one raised no error, but with consistency ALL, I got the following error:
        NoHostAvailable: ('Unable to complete the operation against any hosts', {<Host: 10.17.203.211:9042 datacenter1>: 
        Unavailable('Error from server: code=1000 [Unavailable exception] message="Cannot achieve consistency level ALL" 
        info={\'consistency\': \'ALL\', \'required_replicas\': 2, \'alive_replicas\': 1}')})

    Except when I ran SELECT * FROM test WHERE id=4;

4. Which of the WHERE id=? values returned successfully with CONSISTENCY ALL when one of the nodes was down? Why do you
think some could be returned but not others?

    Value 4 was successful. When we set the consistency to ALL, this means that all nodes must respond to the query,
    but with one node down, this will fail if the node contains the data we need.

5. What was the CREATE TABLE statement you used for the nasalogs table? What was the primary key you choose, and why?

    CREATE TABLE nasalogs (
    host TEXT,
    datetime TIMESTAMP,
    path TEXT,
    bytes INT,
    id UUID,
    PRIMARY KEY (host, id)
  );

    I used (host, id) as the primary key since we are going to aggregate by host and want them on the same node. The
    id field helps make each record unique.

6. What was the CQL query you used (or tried) to get the total number of bytes?

    SELECT SUM(bytes) FROM nasalogs;
